  Brief description of the DonaMCP class and its methods:

  The DonaMCP class serves as the central orchestrator for all MCP capabilities. Key methods include:

  - initialize(): Sets up all MCP modules and their dependencies with comprehensive error handling
  - getAvailableCapabilities(): Returns a structured list of all available MCP functions organized by
  module
  - executeCapability(mcpName, method, params): Executes a specific MCP method with detailed logging and
  error tracking
  - getArxivMCP(): Returns the ArXiv MCP instance for direct access to research paper functionality
  - searchResearchPapers(query, maxResults, category): High-level method for research paper searches with
   category filtering
  - getSystemStatus(): Provides comprehensive system status including uptime, cache statistics, and
  module health
  - healthCheck(): Performs thorough health checks on all modules with detailed diagnostics
  - dispose(): Comprehensive cleanup method to properly shut down all MCP connections and clear resources
  - getConfiguration(mcpName): Retrieves configuration for specific MCPs or entire system
  - updateConfiguration(mcpName, newConfig): Dynamic configuration updates for runtime optimization

  - interactWithElement(sessionId, action, selector, value): Element interaction (click, type, select,
  hover)
  - Session management with automatic cleanup and resource optimization
  - Smart content parsing for text, links, images, and structured data

  WeatherMCP: Comprehensive weather information and forecasting service
  - getCurrentWeather(location, units): Real-time weather conditions with multiple unit systems
  - getForecast(location, days, units): Multi-day weather forecasting with 3-hour intervals
  - getWeatherByCoordinates(lat, lon, units): Geographic coordinate-based weather retrieval
  - getAirQuality(lat, lon): Air quality index and pollutant concentration data
  - searchLocations(query, limit): Location search with geographical disambiguation
  - getWeatherAlerts(lat, lon): Severe weather alerts and warnings
  - Intelligent caching system with 10-minute TTL for optimal API usage

  Example usage of the DonaMCP class to access various MCP capabilities:

  const DonaMCP = require('./src/DonaMCP');

  async function demonstrateUsage() {
      const dona = new DonaMCP();
      await dona.initialize();

      // ArXiv: Search for research papers with category filtering
      const papers = await dona.searchResearchPapers("transformer neural networks", 5, "cs.LG");
      console.log(`Found ${papers.length} machine learning papers`);

      // Get detailed paper information with caching
      const paperDetails = await dona.executeCapability('arxiv', 'getPaperDetails', '1706.03762');
      console.log(`Paper: ${paperDetails.title}`);

      // GitHub: Search repositories and get detailed information
      const repos = await dona.executeCapability('github', 'searchRepositories', 'react typescript', {
          limit: 5, sort: 'stars'
      });

      // Get repository file content
      const fileContent = await dona.executeCapability('github', 'getFileContent',
          'facebook', 'react', 'README.md');

      // Puppeteer: Advanced web scraping with session management
      const sessionId = await dona.executeCapability('puppeteer', 'createSession', {
          blockResources: ['image', 'stylesheet']
      });

      const scrapingResult = await dona.executeCapability('puppeteer', 'scrapeUrl',
          'https://news.ycombinator.com', {
              sessionId,
              persistent: true,
              selectors: {
                  headlines: '.storylink',
                  scores: '.score'
              }
          });

      // Weather: Multi-location weather monitoring
      const weather = await dona.executeCapability('weather', 'getCurrentWeather', 'Tokyo,JP', 'metric');
      const forecast = await dona.executeCapability('weather', 'getForecast', 'London,UK', 5);

      // System monitoring and health checks
      const capabilities = dona.getAvailableCapabilities();
      const systemStatus = dona.getSystemStatus();
      const healthCheck = await dona.healthCheck();

      console.log('Available capabilities:', Object.keys(capabilities));
      console.log('System uptime:', systemStatus.uptime);
      console.log('All modules healthy:', healthCheck.healthy);

      // Direct MCP access for advanced usage
      const arxivMCP = dona.getArxivMCP();
      const categories = arxivMCP.getCategories();
      const cacheStats = arxivMCP.getCacheStats();

      // Configuration management
      const arxivConfig = dona.getConfiguration('arxiv');
      dona.updateConfiguration('arxiv', { maxResults: 20 });

      await dona.dispose();
  }
